    "1. #### What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "   ##### Compiled Languages:\n",
    "   - These require a separate step where the entire code is converted into machine language before it can run. This produces an executable file that the        computer can directly understand. Since compilation happens beforehand, compiled programs tend to run faster. Examples include C, C++, and Rust.\n",
    "   ##### Interpreted Languages:\n",
    "   - These are executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime, meaning thereâ€™s no separate compilation step. Since the code runs directly without being compiled into machine language beforehand, interpreted languages are generally slower but provide more flexibility for debugging and dynamic execution. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby."

Its primary purpose is to allow for cleanup actions, such as releasing resources or closing connections, before the object is garbage collected."

    "    - Memory management in Python refers to the process of efficiently allocating, using, and freeing memory during program execution.

Proper memory handling allows Python programs to run smoothly, especially when dealing with complex applications or large datasets. By automating tasks like allocation and cleanup, Python's memory manager optimizes performance, reduces developer workload, and supports scalability. It plays a vital role in balancing usability and efficiency in Python applications."

    "\n",
    "    ##### Reference Counting:\n",
    "    - Python tracks the number of references to each object. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it means no part of the program is using         it, and the memory is freed.\n",

    "    - Python has a built-in garbage collector that handles cyclic references (objects referencing each other). It identifies and collects these objects       even when their reference count is non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ##### Generational Collection:\n",
    "    - Python organizes objects into three generations (young, middle-aged, old) to optimize performance. Frequently used objects stay in older generations, while less-used ones are collected more often in younger generations."
